- ***Key Components and Relationships***
	- ***Site and Application Sections:***
		- These sections represent the “`Site`” and “`Application`” environments.
			- The Site contains the Persistent Volume, Storage Class, and Provisioner.
			- The Application section houses the Pod, Containers, and Volumes.
		- ***Arrows***:
		  •	The arrow from `Provisioner` to `Storage Class` indicates that the `provisioner` creates the storage class.
		  •	`Storage Class` connects to Persistent Volume with an arrow, indicating it defines the characteristics of persistent storage.
		  •	The `BOUND` label between Persistent Volume and `PVC` (Persistent Volume Claim) signifies that the volume is bound to a claim.
		  •	`PVC` connects to Volumes within the Pod, showing that the storage is mounted for use by the container(s) in the pod.
		- ***Components***:
		  •	Each component, such as `Persistent Volume`, `Storage Class`, and `Provisioner`, is shown in its own box.
		  •	The `Pod` contains `Containers` and `Volumes`, representing the relationship within a Kubernetes `pod`.
